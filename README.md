## 🏗️ Contract Architecture

The contracts are designed as an interconnected ecosystem:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Equipment           │
│ Verification        │ ──┐
└─────────────────────┘   │
                          │
┌─────────────────────┐   │    ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Performance Data    │ ──┼──→ │ Optimization        │
│ Sharing             │   │    │ Recommendation      │
└─────────────────────┘   │    └─────────────────────┘
                          │
┌─────────────────────┐   │    ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Best Practice       │ ──┘    │ Collaborative       │
│ Distribution        │        │ Improvement         │
└─────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

1. **Equipment Verification** serves as the foundation - only verified equipment can participate
2. **Performance Data Sharing** builds on verified equipment for trusted benchmarking
3. **Optimization Recommendations** use shared data to provide improvement suggestions
4. **Best Practice Distribution** facilitates knowledge sharing across the network
5. **Collaborative Improvement** enables joint optimization projects
